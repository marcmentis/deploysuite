.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBdb_backup\.rb\fR is a simple command\-line tool for backing up a MySQL database\. It does so safely and quietly, using a sensible name for the backup files, so it\'s perfect for use with cron as a daily backup\. By default, \fBdb_backup\.rb\fR makes a daily backup and names the resulting backup file with the date\. \fBdb_backup\.rb\fR also understands our development process, so if you specify the \fB\-\-iteration\fR flag, the backup will be named differently than for a daily backup\. This will allow you to easily keep one backup per iteration, easily identifying it, and differentiate it from daily backups\. By default, \fBdb_backup\.rb\fR will use your database credentials in \fB~/\.my\.cnf\fR, however, you can override either the username or password (or both) via the \fB\-u\fR and \fB\-p\fR flags, respectively\. Finally, \fBdb_backup\.rb\fR will add a sanity check on your username, to make sure it fits with our corporate standard format of \fBfirst\.last\fR\.
.
.SH "FILES"
\fB~/\.my\.cnf\fR is used for authentication if \fB\-u\fR or \fB\-p\fR is omitted\.
